# WheelsUnleashed


This is a project inspired by the game Sea of Stars, more specifically the the minigame "Wheels" inside of the game

This my attempt at making a multiplayer version of this game to be played online using Django (my first time using it)



TODO:
Implement DB for users (uname, password, DisplayName)\n
Add stats to be displayed on either lobby or other menu\n
Game selector\n
Wheels itself
